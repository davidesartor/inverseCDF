# ReLU Monotonic Neural Network
## Requirements
This code has been run with `Python 3.10.14` and `PyTorch 2.5.1`. Once installed, the only other libraries that might be needed are `tqdm` and `matplotlib`.

## Repository structure
The `data` folder already contains the CSV for the datasets. Instead `exp_{dataset}.ipynb` contains the training loop and the evaluation for the corresponding `dataset`
